# üåê Locadex i18n

This repository is configured to use Locadex for automated internationalization.

## Configuration:

- **Working Directory**: `.`
- **Branch Prefix**: `locadex/`

## How it works:

- Locadex will automatically analyze your code for translatable content every time you open a PR
- Locadex will modify your build command to automatically generate translations for your content in your configured locales
- Locadex will push its changes to your PR branch, which you can review and merge

## Next Steps:
1. **Get API Keys**: Visit [General Translation Dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com) to generate API Keys
2. **Add API Keys**: Add a Production API Key and Project ID to your project CI workflow to keep your translations up to date
3. In development, using a Development API Key will allow you to hot-reload translations in your app as you make changes
